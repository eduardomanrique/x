## X Web Framework
The framework was made for fun, and because there were no framework that worked just the way I wanted! Its intention is to be fast to code, easy to maintain, and clear. It is a server/client (js) integrated framework with the js scripts dinamically generated, to make the client/server integration easier.
The framework is being used to create a real world project, and it's almost ready. 

As soon as possible the documentation will be here.

Thanks!
